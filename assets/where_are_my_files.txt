=====================
 Where are my files?
=====================

By default, this pipeline does not save large intermediate files to the
results directory. This is to try to conserve disk space.

These files can be found in the pipeline `work` directory if needed.
Alternatively, re-run the pipeline using `-resume` in addition to one of
the below command-line options and they will be copied into the results directory:

`--saveTrimmed`
Specify to save trimmed FastQ files to the results directory.

-----------------------------------
 Setting defaults in a config file
-----------------------------------
If you would always like these files to be saved without having to specify this on
the command line, you can save the following to your personal configuration file
(eg. `~/.nextflow/config`):

params.saveTrimmed = true
